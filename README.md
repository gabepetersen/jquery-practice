# jquery-practice

This is a website for me to practice all of the jquery documentation, and doing so, 
I have made examples of what is possible with jquery into a single html page.

### Apologies
1. For the insanely messy code
2. For no code splitting
3. For poor node app setup lol

### How to Run
1. `npm i`

2. `npm run dev`

3. Navigate to localhost:3000 (or your process.env.PORT)
